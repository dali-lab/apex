### Installation

```pod install```

use `Apex.xcworkspace`

### Inspiration
The Dartmouth Outing Club is an essential part of the Dartmouth community, organizing trips weekly for different types of activities and people. However, the way these trips are organized is very inefficient and not conductive to new members. Different groups have different methods of conducting their trips, some using massive email chains while others have google spreadsheets. Apex is inspired by the DOC to make trip organization seamless and easy for anyone to sign up.

###  What it does
Uses can sign up with only their email and password. After registering, users are directly towards upcoming trips. Clicking on a trip brings you to a more detailed view of the trip including description, group sizes, location, and many beautiful images. If interested a user can choose to join a trip. There is also a separate tab to view all of the trips you have signed up for.

###  How we built it
Apex is built using Firebase, a Google platform as a service technology that provides an on the fly NoSQL database, perfect for prototyping and iOS.

###  What's next for Apex
- Messaging client to send messages to all members in a group
- Calendar integration through calendar events
- Payment integration with Venmo API
- Event subscription: being able to subscribe for event updates from a specific location, group, or event type
